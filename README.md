# What is this Project?

This project is a Streamlit-based weather forecast 
application that enables users to view the weather 
forecast for any city for up to five days. Users 
can input a city name and select the forecast 
length using a slider. The application offers two
types of forecasts: temperature and sky view 
(clear, clouds, rain, snow), displaying the data 
in a line graph for temperature or images for sky 
conditions. The backend, using the OpenWeatherMap API
, fetches and filters the forecast data. If a user
inputs an incorrect city, the application prompts
them to correct it. This tool combines data 
fetching, processing, and interactive visualization
to provide an accessible weather forecasting 
service.
